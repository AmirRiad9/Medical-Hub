# Medical-Hub
A platform that patients and medical professionals can use to book, get notifications, leave messages, store their medical data and look up their history. 

The Device_Module branch will contain the code implementation for the devices, and all the information enetered by the user or the admin will be stored in a txt file for testing purposes.

Created another branch called Device_Class which is the Device module implemented using a Device class and with attributes and objects related to the class. After asking for user information the data is stored in .txt file in json format.
